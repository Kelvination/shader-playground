## üìù Writing Shaders

The playground uses standard GLSL fragment shaders. Here's a basic template:

```glsl
uniform float time;
uniform vec2 resolution;
varying vec2 vUv;

void main() {
    vec2 st = vUv;
    
    // Your shader code here
    vec3 color = vec3(st.x, st.y, abs(sin(time)));
    
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

### Available Uniforms

- `time` - Elapsed time in seconds
- `resolution` - Canvas resolution in pixels
- `mouse` - Mouse position (normalized 0-1)

### Tips for Getting Started

1. Start with one of the example shaders
2. Make small changes and see how they affect the output
3. Use the parameter sliders to experiment with values
4. Try different geometries to see how your shader maps to 3D surfaces
5. Check the console for detailed error messages if compilation fails
